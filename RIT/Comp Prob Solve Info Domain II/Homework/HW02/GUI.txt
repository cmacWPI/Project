-- How to Exit GUI --

Simple, try to solve this riddle and reach 100% progress in GUI title and the exit button will be unlocked. 

If it reached 100% progress, it will show the message saying "Congratulations!" to the user.

To end it right now, go to [File] then click [End] 3 times in row. After that, go to [File] --> [Exit] to end the program.

-- List of Controls in GUI --

Menu - Has two menu, [File] and [Help] with it one of submenus that starts the program [End]

All submenus of [File] writes text to JTextArea

All of its controls minus menu bar have their position randomized on each start up.

- CheckBox Signs -
Checking and unchecking one of checkbox sometimes increase and then decrease (or the opposite way!) the progress %.
All of checkbox signs increases then decreases by different value, and are not same. While they do share same function, each checkbox increases/decreases the progress by a lot while other increases or decreases a little. Also by checking one of the checkboxes, the other checkboxes will be disabled until the checked checkbox becomes unchecked.

- Add/Subtract RadioButton -
Add: As it may looks like it is adding, it is actually decreases your progress.
Subtract: As it may looks like it is subtracting, it actually increases your progress.

- Four JButtons -
All JButton minus Exit writes text to JText Area
Check - Performs the last task if the progress is near 100% complete, else writes text to JTextArea, and is actually a function of [Submit] button
Submit - If the progress is 1% or higher, it writes text to JTextArea and is actually a function of [Check] button.
Reset - Writes text to JTextArea and half reset the value by the amount based on progress %.
Exit - Once it reached 100% progress, the button will be unlocked and then allows the user to exit the program.

Note: Just by clicking X/Red Dot on upper right of Frame doesn't kill the program.
