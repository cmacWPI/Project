 	<h1>Summary/Plot</h1>
  	<p>The story took place five years later after Majin Buu's defeat, which
  	determines the fate of whole universe. There was a far stronger enemey
  	out there, far stronger than the villians that Z Fighters have ever faced.
  	Birus (due to fan-translations, some call him Bills, other called him Beerus),
  	the God of Destruction has woken from his long 39-years slumber.</p>
  	<p>Birus, after woken from his long slumber, was told by Whis and much to
  	his surprise that Freiza was killed at hands of Son Goku. Hearing the news
  	about it with mentioned "Super Saiyan", he became interested and recalled 
  	his prophetic dream where he encounted an being known as "Super Saiyan God".
  	39 years ago, before his slumber, Oracle Fish told him that an mighty opponent
  	would appeared before him as "Super Saiyan God".</p>
  	<p>Whis told him that majority of Sayians live on "Planet 4032-877" which
  	is Earth, however told him Goku is on King Kai's planet. Birus set 
 	off to fight him. Prior to Birus's awakening, Goku was excited to challenge
 	him after learning things about God of Destruction was a powerful foe 
 	from King Kai. When Birus arrived on King Kai's planet, Goku challenged him
 	however, he was defeated in two strikes at his Super Saiyan 3 form.
 	Birus was disappointed, due to lack of challenge and sets off to Earth,
 	hoping for powerful foe in Earth. King Kai warned Vegeta right away
 	about Birus's upcoming arrival to Earth. Upon hearing this, he was
 	prepared to cast his pride aside to put him in good mood. He arrived
 	and interupted Bulma's birthday party.</p>
  	<p>Upon arriving, he casually greeted Vegeta and his wife, and particpated
  	in her birthday party and is enjoying it. After two incidents, where the gun
  	bullet hits Birus's forehead and Buu ate all of pudding in front of his face,
  	he proceeds to destory Earth. The Z fighters quicky notices it and then tries
  	to fight him, but later was all defeated easily. Vegeta's rage became stronger 
  	than Goku when Birus slapped Bulma, was able to fight him, but is stil defeatd
  	by him.</p>
  	<p> Goku arrived the scene and summoned Shenlong to tell him how to
  	make Super Saiyan God, and Shenlong proceeds to tell him about the legend
  	of Super Saiyan God in Planet Vegeta and how he appeared to stop evil 
  	Saiyans but failed. He later proceeds to tell him that to turn into 
  	Super Saiyan God, it requires powers of six pure-hearted Saiyans, and thanks
  	to help from them, he was able to turn into Super Saiyan God which is 
  	far stronger than Super Saiyan 3 and also fufilled Oracle Fish's 
  	prophecy.</p>
  	<p>Having turned into Super Saiyan God, he was able to fight Birus in
  	equal footing, however Birus pushed him back with his strongest attack.
  	During the crisis, he had a flashback and turned back into god form, which
  	he absorbed energy ball. He, however, told to him that he lost and the fight
  	was over, and Birus told him two interesting infomation. Having said that, and
  	bid farewell, Birus returned to his temple, but Whis knocks him out and told him
  	to go to sleep for three years.
