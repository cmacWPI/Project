  	<h1>Movie Biography</h1>
  	<p>Few years later after Majin Buu, he trains on King Kai's planet. During
  	his training, he overhears an discussion from King Kai, and later learns
  	about Birus being powerful foe far stronger than Majin Buu. Eager about it, 
  	he wishes to challenge him. Upon challenging Birus on King Kai's planet, he 
  	is overwhelmed and lost in two hits in his Super Saiyan 3 form.</p> 
  	<p>Upon his defeat, he went to Earth and watches as Vegeta was fighting 
  	Birus, but does it to form strategy, however it was useless. He later used
  	Dragon Balls to summon Shenlong and asked him how to create Super Saiyan
  	God. With the help of other five pure-hearted Saiyans, he exceeds the form
  	beyond Super Sayian 3 and became Super Saiyan God.</p>
  	<p>Upon reaching the form, he confronts Birus again and they were evenly
  	matched. However, he returned back to normal after time limt ran out, but
  	he did not notice as he has already absorbed Super Saiyan God's power into
  	his body. The battle went on until Birus wins upon using his technique, 
  	God of Destruction Super Energy Sphere. He barely can hold back his techinque,
  	but later turns to Super Saiyan God and then absorbed his energy sphere.</p>
  	<p>Having acknowledged Birus's power is far beyond his level, he admitted defeat
  	which ended the fight. Whis offered him a job to be next God of Destruction if
  	Birus dies, but he declined Whis's offer, and Supereme Kais was surprised
  	that Goku manage to befriended Birus.</p>
