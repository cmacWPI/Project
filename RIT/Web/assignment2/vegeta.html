  	<h1>Movie Biography</h1>
  	<p>Few years later after Majin Buu, Vegeta was training until King Kai 
  	warned him about Birus's arrival to Earth(He did not attend his wife's birthday
  	party at that time, since he wanted to train). Upon hearing this, he
  	went to Bulma's birthday party to warn everyone, but Birus arrived before
  	he could do that. After being face-to-face once agian, he knew Birus is
  	very dangerous and is ready to cast aside his pride to put him in good 
  	mood and starts playing party-host.</p>
  	<p>It failed when Majinn Buu angered Birus, and Vegeta tried to fight him, but
  	is defeated. He admitted defeat and when he was about to be finished off,
  	Bulma arrived in the scene and scolds Birus telling him that he ruined her
  	birthday party and then slapped him. Birus later returns favor and slapped
  	her back, causing Vegeta to explode in rage, which allows him to be stronger
  	than Goku for a moment. He went to fight Birus again and after his rage 
  	calmed down, Birus is left unscathed. He was about to accept his fate along with
  	planet's fate, but Goku steps in and he helped Goku to reach Super
  	Super Saiyan God form. After the fight, he demands Goku to help him to reach
  	Super Saiyan God this time and was being needled by Goku when he shouted
  	his wife's name after Birus slapped her.</p>
