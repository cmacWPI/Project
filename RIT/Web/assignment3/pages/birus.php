  	<h1>Movie Biography</h1>
  	<p>When he awoken up, it gave Supreme Kais and Kais a terrible feeling, as he was
  	most feared god. When he wakes up, he destorys planet, since destruction
  	was required to create new planets. He does it according to his own judgement and
  	can even destory important planets without heistation.</p>
  	<p>Thirty-nine years ago before Birus went to sleep, Oracle Fish tells him, that
  	a strong opponent would appear before him known as Super Saiyan God. He asked
  	Whis if Freiza destoryed Planet Vegeta, and Whis stated it did happened, but
  	told him that he was later killed by at hands of Goku. Upon hearing this, he 
  	kept ponding about Super Saiyan God and is later convinced, due to Goku that
  	defeated Freiza. He later tracks Goku down and found him on King Kai's planet.</p>
  	<p>Upon arriving in King Kai's planet, he complained about his planet being 
  	too small and Whis reminded him that he destoryed his planet when he lost in 
  	game. He questioned Goku about Super Saiyan God he responded that he didn't know
  	about Super Saiyan God, however was demostrated all of Super Saiyan forms. 
  	He then challenged him to fight but was disappointed with lack of challenge after 
  	defeating Goku in two hits. He later left to Earth looking for more Saiyans
  	to see if they know about Super Saiyan God.</p>
  	<p>He arrives in Capsule Corporation, where Bulma's birthday party was held. 
  	He casually greeted Vegeta and his wife and then later easily acclimates himself in 
  	her birthday party. When he saw puddings on Buu's plate, and politely asked him
  	for one or two puddings. But he was angered after Buu ate all of puddings, and sent
  	Buu flying into lake, and then decides to destory the Earth. The Z Fighter took
  	notice of it and tries to fight him, but is easily defeated. Goku shows up
  	and turns into Super Saiyan God form with help of other five pure-hearted
  	Sayians, and they fought again. Much to his surprise, he points out to Goku
  	saying his god form's time limit has ran out, yet didn't greatly power down.</p>
  	<p>The fight went on until he wins by using "God of Destruction Super Energy Sphere"
  	and then Goku surrenders, after absorbing his techinque. When he returned to
  	ground, he tries to destory the planet, but only destoryed a small piece of rock
  	and claimed that he already ran out of power after fight. He later explains
  	to them about his job and about Whis being stronger than him. After that, he returned back to his
  	temple with Whis, and tried some of wasabi, but it caused his head to become red
  	and destoryed some of the moon. Whis arrives and stopped him and later orders
  	him to go to sleep for three more years.</p>
